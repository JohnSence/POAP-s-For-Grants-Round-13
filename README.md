# POAP-s-For-Grants-Round-13
My submission for POAP For Grants Round 13

POAP design is inspired by web3, Space, decentralization and the people who give grants therefore showing them building rockets and getting ready to launch in the space.

The entire layout is modular with different types of tiers and shapes allowing for quick changes in tier system. There are 3 shape types and 4 color schemes.
